##Challenges faced + improvements

Edit/Update Not Reflecting in Table
‚Ä¢	Initially, editing a user in the modal did not update the table immediately.
‚Ä¢	Reason: The table component was not properly updating its state after a successful API update.
‚Ä¢	Fixed by lifting the updated user state back to the parent component and re-rendering the table.
Sorting Users
‚Ä¢	Sorting by multiple fields (ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, Company) needed proper handling.
‚Ä¢	Challenge: Maintaining sort state across re-renders and updating the table dynamically.
‚Ä¢	Fixed by implementing sortConfig in state and sorting the filtered array before rendering.
Pagination & Rows Per Page
‚Ä¢	Initially, the table did not adjust based on ‚Äúrows per page‚Äù selection.
‚Ä¢	Challenge: Slicing the filtered user array correctly and keeping pagination in sync.
‚Ä¢	Fixed by recalculating the visible rows every time itemsPerPage or currentPage changed.

##Improvements Made
Sorting & Filtering
‚Ä¢	Implemented column-wise sorting with arrows (‚ñ≤‚ñº) for user clarity.
‚Ä¢	Combined search and filter logic with sorting to improve user experience.
Responsive Design
‚Ä¢	Added media queries for 768px screens.
‚Ä¢	Buttons stack vertically on small screens.
‚Ä¢	Table content wraps, preventing horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.
Pagination
‚Ä¢	Users can select rows per page (5, 10, 25, 50, 100).
‚Ä¢	Table updates immediately when rows per page change.
Reusable Components
‚Ä¢	Created UserForm for add/edit operations.
‚Ä¢	Created EditUserModal for modular edit functionality.
‚Ä¢	Table, search, filter, pagination components are reusable.
